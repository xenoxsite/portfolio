# RXWM

## Overview

**RXWM** is a **fork of DWM (Dynamic Window Manager)**, where I **completely redesigned** the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to enhance usability while retaining DWM’s lightweight nature. The redesign focuses on **modern aesthetics**, **intuitive keybindings**, and **performance optimization** for a more user-friendly workflow.

RXWM provides a streamlined and efficient experience, offering both **customization** and a **polished interface** for users who prefer a minimalist yet functional environment.
